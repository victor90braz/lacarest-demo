## PHP String Handling: Double Quotes vs. Single Quotes

### Double Quotes (" "):

- Variables enclosed in double quotes are replaced with their values. This is known as variable interpolation.

- Escape sequences (e.g., `\n`, `\t`, `\"`) are interpreted and converted to special characters.

- Example:
  ```php
  $name = "John";
  echo "Hello, $name!";
  // Outputs: Hello, John!
  ```

### Single Quotes (' '):

- Variables inside single quotes are not interpolated; they are treated as literal strings.

- Escape sequences are not interpreted within single quotes. Everything inside single quotes is treated as a plain string.

- Example:
  ```php
  $name = "John";
  echo 'Hello, $name!';
  // Outputs: Hello, $name!
  ```
